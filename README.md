# Rat-and-human-comparative-development
The objective of this project is to study the temporal relationship of development between humans and rats.  Our approach involves analyzing the time frame required for a common set of developmental markers to be achieved in both species. To gather data, we conducted a bibliographic survey and compared our findings with other databases existing in the literature about the same topic. The resulting databases were carefully curated and integrated, providing a comprehensive timeline of rat development that spans the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal periods. In total, the dataset includes 497 individual dates for each species, making it the most comprehensive study of its kind to date.

Now the preprint of the manuscript is available at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.11.536227

The database will be publicly available and free to use after peer-review and acceptance of the manuscript.
Also we developed an interactive dashboard with plotly
