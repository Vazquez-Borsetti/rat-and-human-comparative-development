## Divergent pattern of development in rats and humans.
To assist researchers in determining the optimal age of animal models throughout development, this website aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the similarities and differences in the developmental trajectory of rats and humans, including embryonic, fetal, perinatal, and postnatal periods. By elucidating key developmental events and milestones, this resource can provide insight about experimental design and aid in the interpretation of research findings.

Vertical and horizontal black lines indicate the birth of each species.

### How to interpret this graph?

The red and green lines encompass 90% (95% to 5% quantiles) of developmental milestones.  At least this must be true if the sample is representative and there are no considerable deviations from the pattern of development.

### How to choose your model?

The first thing to consider is that the patterns of development diverge, thus there is not a univocal relationship between the age of one species and the other. The best bet is to consider which are the most important milestones that could affect your model and select the ages based on that criterion. For example, if you work with perinatal asphyxia the birth may play an important role in the physiopathology of the process that you are studying.
You can also use different ages, inside reasonable margins as proposed in this analysis, and validate your model based on the similarities with patients’ pathophysiology.
