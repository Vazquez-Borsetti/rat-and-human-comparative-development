## Divergent pattern of development in rats and humans.
To assist researchers in determining the optimal age of animal models throughout development, this website aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the similarities and differences in the developmental trajectory of rats and humans, including embryonic, fetal, perinatal, and postnatal periods. By elucidating key developmental events and milestones, this resource can provide insight about experimental design and aid in the interpretation of research findings.
